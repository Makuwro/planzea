# Thanks!
You're interested in making Projects better? That's super cool! We really appreciate your help, and we have no problem accepting your pull request. 

# Things to note
## Before working on Projects
* Make sure your project follows the Makuwro [terms of service](https://support.makuwro.com/policies/terms) and [privacy policy](https://support.makuwro.com/policies/privacy).

* Make sure there's a relevant feature request or bug report in the [issues](https://github.com/Makuwro/projects/issues). If there isn't one, no biggie: [you can just make one](https://github.com/Makuwro/projects/issues/new).

* Make sure sure no one else is assigned to the issue.

  * If you created the issue, say that you're working on the issue.
  
  * If someone else besides yourself created the issue, leave a comment that you want to work on the issue. Projects maintainers will assign you to the issue. 

## While working on your contribution
* **Please do not point your pull request to the main branch!** Point your directory to the branch of the upcoming version. For example, if v1.0.0 is the current latest version, check if there is a v2.0.0, v1.1.0, or v1.0.1 branch.

  * If your contribution fixes bugs, use the patch branch. For example, v1.0.1.
  
  * If your contribution adds backwards-compatible features (meaning your contribution does **not** break something that works), use the minor branch. For example, v1.1.0.

  * If your contribution adds features or fixes bugs that make the app backwards-incompatible, make sure you get explicit approval from the Projects maintainers first. Then, use the major branch. For example, v2.0.0.

## After you submit your pull request
* Projects maintainers will review your request as soon as possible. Please do not resubmit your pull request. 

* Why not share it in [Da Dragon Den Discord server](https://discord.gg/daP2KZc)?
